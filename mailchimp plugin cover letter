Paul,

After reading over your application this looks like a perfect fit for my skill sets. I have integrated/maintained/fixed mailchimp accounts in WordPress/Drupal/SugarCRM/PHP/Laravel Projects.

My name is Hardik Dangar and I am an Web Develpoer and PHP/Laravel expert. I love Mailchimp and I have a large portfolio of sites built specifically using this plugin.

Below you can see a portfolio of my recent projects.

Some of recent projects,

http://judiskkronika.se/
http://hotboxsmokeshop.net/


While I am certain there will be others who underbid me on this project, I can assure you several things. 

I work extremely fast
I can resolve server issues as well as I am avid Ubuntu linux user. So I can handle issues even if it's at the server network level.
You can expect quality communication in regards to the project.

A few questions I have for you about the project:
- I would need to know mailchimp plugin/API version you are using in projects to find the exact issue.

Thanks,
Hardik
